    <p><font color="red"><b>Can I withdraw my PFO?</b></font><br/>
        Under normal circumstances, an applicant cannot withdraw a proposal for occupancy (PFO).
        Your PFO is a legal offer of intent to inhabit property, much like 
        submitting a written offer for purchasing a house. However, the landlord 
        for the property for which an applicant may have submitted a PFO may allow you to 
        withdraw your PFO, especially if other, more attractive PFOs have been submitted.</p>

    <p><font color="red"><b>What about commissions, brokerage, and agency relationships?</b></font><br/>
        An agency relationship is only formed with a landlord when he decides to utilize the
        back-end payment option to access and pursue the submitted PFOs. This relationship is
        referred to as a Facilitator relationship and favors neither the landlord of the applicant.
        The back-end fee, if chosen, is referred to as commission for introducing two parties
        to a potential transaction. All agency relationship limitations are disclosed to and
        agreed by the landlord before proceeding with appropriate transactions with Leasehood.
        If the landlord chooses the front-end listing fee, no agency relationship is established.
        Rather, only a listing fee is charged.</p>

    <p><font color="red"><b>What if I missed the open house and another is not scheduled?</b></font><br/>
        Typically, an open house will be offered at the beginning of the home's Show Period
        and possibly at the end of the Show Period.  If you have missed all open houses, you 
        may email the landlord at anytime to request an additional open house be held.  The 
        landlord may or may not offer an additional open house, but the more requests he 
        receives, the more likely he will offer an additional open house, especially if few 
        or no PFOs have been submitted.  If a landlord offers an additional open house, and 
        the property is listed as a "Favorite" property in the applicant's account, the applicant 
        will be informed of the details of the additional open house. </p>
