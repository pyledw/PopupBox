        LeaseHood is honored to be members of several organizations that help integrate itself with the real estate industry and local business development; we believe involvement helps foster our desire to cooperate with other liked-minded parties.</p>

<p>As a member of the Greater Nashville Association of Realtors®, LeaseHood embraces other professionals within the real estate industry and commits to conduct itself ethically and respectfully to all parties involved.  Essentially, what separates a Realtor® from a non-Realtor® is the commitment to a higher calling by complying with a comprehensive code of ethics.  If for some reason you feel LeaseHood has conducted itself unethically during your experience, please contact us here.  </p>

<p>As a member of the local Chamber of Commerce, LeaseHood involves itself with the leadership and economic prosperity of fellow businesses within the community.</p> 

<p><u>Licensing</u><br/>
LeaseHood maintains a Real Estate Broker license within the state of Tennessee.  "Brokerage" and "Agency" typiclly refer to the compensation for the introducton of two opposing parties for the execution of a real estate transaction .  Since all properties are listed with an up-front fee regardless of whether a transaction occurs, such listing fee is considered a listing fee only and not compensation and therefore not brokerage.  However, LeaseHood, LLC maintains a Real Estate Broker License and is part of the local chapter of the National Association of Realtors.</p>
