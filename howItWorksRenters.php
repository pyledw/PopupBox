    <p>LeaseHood presents available properties to qualified applicants.  Typically, properties are available for a Show Period, usually 7-21 days, and the applicant can submit an online Proposal for Occupancy (PFO), consisting of the rental amount the applicant is willing to pay, any special occupancy conditions (pets, smoking, etc), and the information contained in their application.  Available homes can be searched by location, size, features, current rental rate, and other parameters.  “Coming Soon” properties are available for viewing and PFO submittal after a specified future date. </p>


    <p><u>Complete Online Application:</u> Before a PFO can be submitted, an applicant must first complete a uniform, online application, similar to traditional applications for rental property.  There is a one-time $6 application fee requried (if your PFO is selected, many landlords will refund the $6 application fee; participating landlords will indicate such on the property listing).  Once your application is completed, LeaseHood will  respond as to the status of your submitted information and advise you on which properties you are most likely to be considered.  A prospective tenant can then submit a PFO, even on multiple properties, but not simultaneously, thus eliminating the need for multiple applications.   There is no fee for submitting a PFO.  Applicants retain their online application for 90 days without repeating the application process  or paying an additional application review and processing fee.  An applicant can update their application at any time.  All applications remain secured on LeaseHood.com and are not distributed to parties other than landlords.  LeaseHood does not verify information collected during the application process.  However, the landlord may, at his discretion, verify any or all information on the application at any time.  Typically, this will occur after the landlord selects the most attractive PFO and the landlord may charge the applicant for such verification.  Application verifications usually include employment history, rental/housing history, salary, references, and criminal background.  <u>It is therefore crucial that all information in your application is correct. </u></p>
    
    <p><u>View the property:</u> Any applicant can view any advertised property.  When a property is first listed on LeaseHood, the Landlord will designate a certain date and time in which an Open House will be conducted.  This will likely occur during the early stage of the Show Period and similar in format to an open house.  A second Open House may be available, as specified in the property’s listing.   Futhermore, interested parties may request that an additional Open House be conducted.</p>


    <p><u>Submit a PFO: </u> After viewing the property, the applicant may choose to submit a Proposal for Occupancy (PFO).  Only one PFO can be submitted at one time to ensure a single party is not considered for multiple lease agreements.   At any given time during the Show Period, the landlord has listed base conditions such as rental rate, available move-in date, rental period, pet policy, etc.  Only the proposed rental rate of each PFO will be available to other interested applicants.  At any time during the Show Period you will be able to see the proposed rental rates by other interested applicants.  You may then propose a similar or higher rental rate.</p>

<p>As the Show Period progresses, your PFO may become subordinate to more attractive PFO by another party who submitted their PFO after yours.   Therefore, you may alter your PFO conditions at any time, including your proposed rental rate.  Also, remember your PFO includes your proposed rental rate AND the information in your application.  So, your entire PFO will be considered by the listing party, not just your proposed rental rate.</p>

<p>The property may be listed with a "Move-in-Now" option.  By selecting this option, the applicant is requesting his PFO be considered immediately and before other current PFOs, if any exist, and at the advertised "Move-in-Now" rental rate.  The "Move-in-Now" option may carry certain applicant restrictions set by the landlord, so not all applicants may be eligible to submit a "Move-in-Now" PFO.  Upon completing an online application, when you view any property, your conformity to the property will be available to you in a visual format.</p>

<p>It is important to understand that your PFO is a legal intent to inhabit real estate with binding conditions.  Under extenuating circumstances, your PFO may be retracted, but only upon authorization of the respective listing party.  Please remember that landlords often employ certain criteria when allowing certain parties to submit a PFO.  For example, your salary may prevent you from submitting a PFO on certain properties.  Or your move-in date may not match that of the landlord.  Or a landlord may prohibit your pet.</p>

<p><u>Landlord Selects Most Attractive PFO: </u> At any time during the Show Period or at the end of the Show Period, the Landlord will review the submitted PFOs.  If the Show Period ends naturally (if a" Move-in-Now "PFO was not accepted), the landlord will have 24 hours in which to decide to persue one or more of the PFOs.  Depending on the perceived credibility of the PFOs submitted, he may choose to contact the respective party of one or more PFOs for a deposit or additional information.   Again, please keep in mind that just because you have submitted a PFO with the highest proposed rental rate does not necessarily mean your PFO will be selected.  Your PFO is a package that consists of your proposed rental terms, occupancy availability, credit worthiness, housing history, background, etc.  If the landlord selects a PFO other than yours, you will be notified that you have been released from you PFO and are free to submit a PFO for another property (at no additional charge during the next  30 days).</p>

<p><u>Lease Agreement is Executed: </u> Assuming both parties agree, a traditional Lease Agreement is then executed and the appropriate deposits are submitted usng traditional meaasures.  Again, the landlord may require a valid background check be completed for the applicant before proceeding, often times paid by the applicant.  The agreement can be executed using traditional hardcopy agreement forms and ink signatures.</p>
