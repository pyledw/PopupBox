    <p>When you list your property, LeaseHood presents it to pre-qualified applicants.  Properties are typically pre-marketed for several weeks, then available for a Show Period, usually 7-21 days, including one or more open houses.  During the Show Period, an applicant can submit an online Proposal for Occupancy (PFO), typically consisting of the rental amount the applicant is willing to pay and any special occupancy conditions (pets, smoking, move-in date, etc).  The PFO also includes the information  contained in the application.</p>


    <p><u>List Your Property: </u> The first step is to list your property with LeaseHood.  Before you list your property, you will need to have image files of your property including its front, kitchen and bathroom views, at a minimum.  You may list a property even if your property will not be vacant until a few days or weeks out, in which case it will be presented as “Coming Soon.”  Generally, the longer your property is marketed as "Coming Soon," the more interest you will generate.  You will then submit information about your property such as property address, number of bedrooms and baths, photos of your property, square feet, pet policy, special comments, etc.   At your option, you will either receive a LeaseHood yard sign or can pick one up at the LeaseHood office at no cost.  A unique text code will be provided to you that you will write on your LeaseHood yard sign that can be called by a prospective drive-by applicant, who will then be directed straight to your listing.  For convenience, this same text code will be used to identify the property when it is listed with LeaseHood.</p>

    
    <p><u>View the property:</u> Any applicant can view any advertised property.  When a property is first listed on LeaseHood, the Landlord will designate a certain date and time in which an Open House will be conducted.  This will likely occur during the early stage of the Show Period and similar in format to an open house.  A second Open House may be available, as specified in the property’s listing.   Futhermore, interested parties may request that an additional Open House be conducted.</p>


    <p><u>Fees: </u>
    <br/>Listing Fee: $60 per property</p>

<p><u>Select a Show Period: </u> As a Landlord, you will select a start date for your Show Period, which is a window of opportunity to solicit PFOs from pre-qualified applicants.  Typically, the Show Period will be 7-21 days.  If you have current residents in your home, ideally the Show Period should end near the time they leave.</p>


<p><u>Select Viewing Dates: </u>During the Show Period, applicants will want to view your property before they submit a PFO.  Similar to an open house,  you will select a date in which the property will be available for viewing by any prospective party and you, or your representative, will conduct the showing.  Typically, the viewing date will occur during the early stage of the Show Period.  In some cases, interested parties that were only introduced to your property during its Show Period and missed your first showing may wan to see the property.  For this reason, it is common to conduct a second viewing date towards the end of the Show Period.  Again, the Show Period is the online window of opportunity for applicants to submit a Proposal for Occupancy (PFO). </p>


<p><u>Select Lease Term Conditions:</u> Before the Show Period officially begins, you will need to enter the proposed terms of the property, such as lease term, rental rate, security deposit amount, last month rent, etc.  You will select at least two rates: a starting rate,  and a Move-in-Now rate.  Throughout this listing process, LeaseHood will recommend certain guidelines to optimize your position as a landlord.</p>

<p>LeaseHood.com allows you to restrict certain applicants from even submitting a PFO for your property based on your preferences and rental conditions.  For example, you may choose to allow only applicants who have a certain salary-to-rent ratio , do not have pets,  can move in on a certain date, do not have a criminal record, etc.  If you do not set minimal standards, you will be encouraged to thoroughly review each application before proceeding to ensure you select the best applicant for your property.</p>

<p><u>Solicit Proposals for Occupancy: </u> Once all the information is submitted, the Show Window starts and you are ready to solicit Proposals for Occupancy (PFOs).  Parties submitting PFOs have paid a $6 application fee and are therefore discouraged to submit phony PFOs.  Additionally, all PFO applicants are screened for database duplicity. </p>
