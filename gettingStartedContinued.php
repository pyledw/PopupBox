                    When a home is advertised for rent on LeaseHood.com, it will typically be available for a 
                    traditional open house at least once during the availability window specified by the landlord.
                    During this availability window, applicants submit their offer conditions for tenancy, providing
                    they meet the minimum standards established by the landlord, if applicable.   Such standards 
                    may include salary, rental history, smoking references, presence and type of pets, move-in date,
                    etc.  After an applicant submits a Proposal for Occupancy (PFO), the applicant's contact information 
                    will be available to the listing party (landlord).  Depending on how the landlord listed his 
                    property, the applicant's personal and contact information may be available to the landlord 
                    as well as the opportunity to contact the landlord.  Only the landlord will have access to 
                    information in the applicant's application; however, all parties can view the rental rate proposed
                    by each applicant.  An applicant can change his PFO at any time, including the offered rental rate.
                    At the end of the availability window, the landlord may choose to pursue his PFOs and contact any 
                    of the applicants to execute a lease agreement.   A “Move-in-Now” option is also available, allowing
                    the applicant to request securing the property immediately, at the landlord's discretion. 
                    Any non-selected applicants may use their on-file application to submit additional PFOs for
                    a 90-day period.
            </p>

                    An inverse model is available as well, essentially reversing the traditional 
                    supply and demand format by categorizing the need for tenancy as the supply and 
                    the actually rental home as the demand.  In this scenario, a prospective tenant
                    completes the application and markets his tenancy to landlords.  The applicant
                    may choose to market his desire to reside in a certain section of town, in a 
                    certain sized home, after a certain date, within a range of monthly rental 
                    rates, etc.  Since many landlords require a minimum salary-to-rent ratio, 
                    such information will be anonymously disclosed by the applicant for the 
                    landlord’s viewing, as well as housing, employment, criminal  history, etc.

                    The strength of LeaseHood.com is its ability to (1) provide eligible applicants
                    for the landlord’s review, thus saving applicant selection and property showing
                    time and (2) find the true market value for rental real estate.  During a traditional
                    “Renter’s” market, (low rental rates and depleted tenant demand) a landlord
                    may struggle to find a resident.  LeaseHood.com provides an opportunity to 
                    let the market decide the rent rate so that the occupancy is filled as soon 
                    as possible , allowing the landlord to establish cash flow (as opposed to being 
                    vacant for months).  The result… both tenant and landlord are happy.  During a 
                    “Landlord’s” market,  the landlord is able to select from a multitude of qualified 
                    applicants, and each applicant’s perceived value of the property is reflected in 
                    their PFO.  Naturally, everyone’s value of the same home may be different; some 
                    higher, some lower.  The result… again, both parties are happy.
            </p>

                    Regardless of whether it’s a “Renter’s” or “Landlord’s” market, there is
                    benefit to advertise your tenancy desires or available property at any 
                    given time.  For example, a landlord may wish to choose from a set of 
                    qualified applicants to fill his vacancy immediately rather than waiting
                    several days or weeks to receive PFOs, regardless of market conditions.  
                    Conversely, an applicant may choose the “Move-in-Now” option should he have 
                    time constraints or other  factors to deal with.
