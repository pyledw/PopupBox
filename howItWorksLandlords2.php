    <p><u>Review Proposals for Occupancy During Show Period:</u> At any time during the Show Period, you can review and monitor the submitted PFOs.   You will be able to view the information in all applicant's application during or after the Show Period to help you make your decision to proceed.  At any time during the Show Period, you may receive a "Move-in-Now" request.  If you select this option, the Show Period closes, you will have access to all applicant personal information, and all bids are voided.</p>
    
    <p><u>Canceling PFOs:</u> Only upon your authorization can an applicant who has submitted a PFO cancel their PFO.</p>

    <p><u>Terminating the Show Period:</u>You may choose to terminate the Show Period early should an applicant choose the “Rent-it-Now” option and you are satisfied with their application.  The Show Period can also be terminated if you select a PFO during the advertised Show Period.  All parties submitting a PFO will be informed of a terminated Show Period, if applicable.  Again, you are not obligated to complete a lease agreement with any applicant at any time.</p>


<p><u>Select a Show Period:</u> As a Landlord, you will select a start date for your Show Period, which is a window of opportunity to solicit PFOs from pre-qualified applicants.  Typically, the Show Period will be 7-21 days.  If you have current residents in your home, ideally the Show Period should end near the time they leave.</p>

<p>If you did not end the Show Period early, you will have 24 hours to take action after the Show Period expires before all PFO applicants will be relieved of their intent to lease your property.  For any listing that does not result in a qualified PFO submission, as determined by the landlord, the property may be relisted within 7 days without additional listing fees.</p>

<p><u>After the Transaction:</u> A standard Lease Agreement, endorsed by the Tennessee Association of Realtors (TAR), is available online should you choose to pursue a PFO/applicant after the Show Period.  Lead Paint Disclosure and Property Condition Disclosure forms are available as well. </p>
