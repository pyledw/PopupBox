        <u>Be completely honest:</u><br />
        This applies to your downloaded photos, property descriptions, and rental 
        expectations.  Consumers are savvy and will be able to clearly identify alternative agendas.  Consumers 
        are more educated and savvy than ever before.  When you don't portray a representative photo of your 
        property’s kitchen, you’re only wasting your time and possibly other’s time.  Consumers want to know how 
        every important aspect of your property looks, without the need to visit your property to find out. 
        Many consumers like kitchens and the exterior of their home; it identifies them.  If you have a substandard 
        property, it should be reflected in your rental price.</p>

        <p><u>Pricing:</u><br/>
        Consider the economy and the supply and demand principle.  Typically, when the economy is down, foreclosures 
        are up, unemployment rates are high, or lending restrictions are tight, there are fewer home buyers.  
        Homes sales are often inversely proportionate to rental rates.  Fewer home buyers mean more renters.  Assuming 
        the number of rental homes (supply) available remains relatively unchanged, there becomes a disproportionate 
        number of seeking renters (demand).  When demand exceeds supply, prices increase.  So, when the economy is down,
        often times a landlord’s market is realized and rental rates are higher.  The inverse is true as well.  Rental 
        rates fluctuate in any given year, and sometimes even by month.  LeaseHood’s primary purpose for landlords is 
        to capture the highest rental rate at any given time, regardless of economic conditions.</p>
    
        <p>As with houses for sale, the single biggest deterrent of a rental property is likely an inappropriate rental 
        price.  Therefore, it is important that you price your property in an educated  and realistic manner.  Recent
        lease agreements and online resources are often used to determine the rental value of a home.  Once you have 
        established a perceived fair market value, your starting price should be below this value.  A good rule of thumb
        is for the starting price to be 80-90% of the market value because you will need to present a starting price for 
        you property that creates interest.  Similarly, you should select a “Move-in-Now” price slightly above market value.
        But be careful.  An unrealistic “Move-in-Now” price will likely deter otherwise interested parties.  Also be 
        mindful that any additional rental rate you receive over your perceived market value will likely yield additional 
        income for the duration of the lease, and often times, beyond.  An extra $50 per month is $600 per year!  But be 
        careful to not be too greedy.</p>
        
        <p><u>Curb Appeal:</u><br />
        Make sure your property is tidy and you maximize the curb appeal.  Many prospective renters assume a house’s 
        inside features are no more attractive than the exterior appearance.   You want to generate interest from 
        street traffic and make them want to read your flyer and visit the open house.  During your home marketing 
        campaign, ensure that the grass height is maintained, flower beds are cleaned, trash is picked up, etc.</p>
    
        <p><u>The Open House and Show Period:</u><br />
        The way a house looks, smells, and sounds are very important.  It is essential that you create an 
        atmosphere to allow the perspective tenant to imagine himself or herself living in your home.  Remove family 
        photos if a tenant is living in the house during show times.  Clean the carpet, wax the floors, patch the 
        walls, clean the closets.   Since the kitchen and bathroom are often the first rooms inspected, ensure they  
        are spotless.  Eliminate any offensive odors and use an air freshener (but don’t overdo it).  Play some smooth 
        jazz, classical, or other inviting music in the background.</p>
    
        <p>For best results, you need to conduct at least one open house.  As far as when to conduct your open house(s),
           there are several alternatives, depending on for how long you intend to make the property available for PFOs:
        <ul>
            <li>If you have marketed your property as a “Coming Soon” property for 7-10 days and intend to solicit PFOs 
                for a short period of time, say 7 days or less, you may want to conduct an open house within a few days 
                or so of making your property available for rent on LeaseHood.com.   If you receive several messages from 
                prospective applicants requesting an additional open house, you may want to schedule an additional open 
                house on or near the last day of the show window.</li>
            <li>If you have marketed your property as a “Coming Soon” property for 7-10 days and intend to solicit PFOs 
                for a longer period of time, say 7-14 days, you may want to conduct an open house within a few days or 
                so of making your property available for rent on LeaseHood.com and an additional open house at or near 
                the end of the show window.</li>
            <li>If you have not marketed your property as a “Coming Soon” property, you may want to consider making your 
                show window 10-14 days.  This way, you will allow more time for interested parties to hit the market.  It is 
                recommended you conduct an open house within 4-7 days after making to property available on LeaseHood.com 
                and an additional open house at or near the end of the show window.</li>
        </ul></p>
        
        <p>Several hundred NEW prospective home renters (not apartment seekers) typically enter the market every 14 days 
            in a metropolitan area of 1 million or more.  So, it is important to expose your property to the most people 
            for the longest duration.  Please use the following  table to assist in selecting your pre-marketing, show 
            window duration and open house parameters:

        According to the Tennessee Consumer Affairs Division, the Tennessee Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act
        was enacted in 1975 to establish the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants involved in rental properties.  
        In general, the provisions of the act apply only to dwelling units residing in counties with a population  of more 
        than 68,000, according to the most recent census.  The full act can be accessed<a href="http://tn.gov/consumer/documents/UniformResidentialLandlordandTenantAct7.12.12.pdf">here</a></p>

        <p><a id="laws"><h4><font color="#78923B"><u>Fair Housing Laws</u></font></h4></a><br />
        The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate in the buying, selling or renting of a home because of a
        person’s race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status and disability. Amendments to the Fair 
        Housing Act added sex as a protected class in 1974 and familial status and disability as protected classes 
        in 1988. </p>
        
        <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        
        <p>Familial status includes children under the age of 18 living with parents or legal custodians, pregnant 
        women and people securing custody of children under the age of 18. To read the Fair Housing Act,<a hre="http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/TNFairHousingReport.pdf">click here</a></p>
      
        <p>States or local governments may enact fair housing laws that extend protections to other groups. 
        Tennessee has included creed as a protected class in the Tennessee Human Rights Act (4-21-600.)</p>
